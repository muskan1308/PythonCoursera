My solutions to mini-projects of Python Programming(Rice University) on Coursera.
This is my attempt to help anyone(and also to help myself) learn Python by performing mini-projects in Python Programming. 
It consists of all the mini-projects that I've completed during the course on Coursera.
Feel free to correct me if my codes are wrong or need improvement cause I'm a beginner in Python programming.
